# Number Sorter done 3 different ways

### 1. Bubble sort
Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are in the intended order

### 2. Selection sort
Selection sort repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part. This process is repeated for the remaining unsorted portion until the entire list is sorted. 

### 3. Insertion sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time by comparisons
